- 🌍 Repository: https://github.com/mblackwellgca/reactPortfolio

## Description

- AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
    - I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
    - SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Installation

    - This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
    - In the project directory, you can run: `npm start` Runs the app in the development mode.\
    - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.\
    - `npm run build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
    - It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Criteria

* WHEN I load the portfolio
    * THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
